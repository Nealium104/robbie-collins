# ðŸ‘‹Hi Robbie

This is a file that shows what this project is and it has some extra stuff at the bottom if you become interested in running this instance locally. If you want to see what the last commit looks like live (remember, this is an in-progress project), you can find it here: https://robbie-portfolio.vercel.app/

This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with create-next-app.

# ðŸ‘‹ Hi other devs

I am a freelance web developer. This project is an aboutMe/portfolio website for a client. This project will be using quite a few dependencies to fulfill client requests. I'll be using Next.js as my framework to handle image optimization, routing, and it should give me a better shot at meeting my stretch goals. I'm traditionally a React developer, but Next seems like it'll do more heavy lifting for me. This is my first Next project. I'll be starting with Tailwind/DaisyUI components just to get code on the page ASAP. Stretch goals for the project include a SendGrid integration for the contact page and a parallax effect using React-Spring. I'll be using unsplash assets as well as photos I am producing for the client. Project completion is set for June 20th, 2023.

# ðŸ¥‚Update
Robbie's site was deemed "completed" on April 30th, 2023, a little under two months ahead of schedule! Both stretch goals of the SendGrid integration and react-spring were met! One last goal is to get the website working with captcha, but I'm going to be spending more time on some personal projects. If you're a developer or just want to chat, feel free to contact me to talk about the project!
