# ðŸ‘‹Hi Robbie

This is the source code I wrote for your project. There's lots of confusing stuff in here, but if you ever want to tinker around, you've got the source files here!

# ðŸ‘‹ Hi other devs

I am a freelance web developer. This project is an aboutMe/portfolio website for a client. I'll be using Next.js as my framework to handle image optimization, routing, and it should give me a better shot at meeting my stretch goals. I'm traditionally a React developer, but Next seems like it'll do more heavy lifting for me. This is my first Next project. I'll be starting with Tailwind/DaisyUI components just to get code on the page ASAP. Stretch goals for the project include a SendGrid integration for the contact page and a parallax effect using React-Spring. I'll be using unsplash assets as well as photos I am producing for the client. Project completion is set for June 20th, 2023.

# Technologies

## Tailwind
I'm using Tailwind for styling. I have a lot of experience with tailwind and it just helps me move really quick with these smaller projects.

## Contentful
I'm using Contentful for the CMS integration. It provides a client that I make API call requests to within the application. That way, I'm not married to a specific setup. It's been really great so far and lets me use my client's accounts.

## Next.js 
Nextjs is nice in that it provides a way to generate the whole site at build time so the site can be built from the data in my CMS and I don't have to worry about loading times other than making sure my assets are optimized. Next.js also provides some image optimization and is just a good way to do things if you already know react.

## SendGrid
I'm using the SendGrid service since my client doesn't want to pay for their own domain email service. The API is pretty easy and it works pretty well.

## Other Libraries
For this project I used a few other libraries. I used DaisyUI's navigation component just because it looked nice and I wanted to try it out. Lots of good stuff from DaisyUI, but I didn't really use it to its best capabilities here. I also used google recaptcha for email validation.

# ðŸ¥‚Update
Robbie's site was deemed "completed" on April 30th, 2023, which means it's ready for my client to share! It was completed significantly ahead of schedule! Both stretch goals of the SendGrid integration and react-spring were met! I also added some validation to the email portion with captcha. If you're a developer or just want to chat, feel free to contact me to talk about the project!

# Update 01-13-24
I've started the process of refactoring for a release with Contentful as a CMS.
