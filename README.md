# ðŸ‘‹Hi Robbie

This is the source code I wrote for your project. There's lots of confusing stuff in here, but if you ever want to tinker around, you've got the source files here!

# ðŸ‘‹ Hi other devs

I am a freelance web developer. This project is an aboutMe/portfolio website for a client. I'll be using Next.js as my framework to handle image optimization, routing, and it should give me a better shot at meeting my stretch goals. I'm traditionally a React developer, but Next seems like it'll do more heavy lifting for me. This is my first Next project. I'll be starting with Tailwind/DaisyUI components just to get code on the page ASAP. Stretch goals for the project include a SendGrid integration for the contact page and a parallax effect using React-Spring. I'll be using unsplash assets as well as photos I am producing for the client. Project completion is set for June 20th, 2023.

# ðŸ¥‚Update
Robbie's site was deemed "completed" on April 30th, 2023, which means it's ready for my client to share! It was completed significantly ahead of schedule! Both stretch goals of the SendGrid integration and react-spring were met! I also added some validation to the email portion with captcha. If you're a developer or just want to chat, feel free to contact me to talk about the project!

I've started the process of refactoring for a release with Contentful as a CMS.
